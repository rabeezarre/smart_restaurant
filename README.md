# SMART RESTAURANT
<b>Description:</b>
Miniature prototype that demonstrates IoT feature incorporated in restaurant, such as contactless menu and ordering, rain protection, automatic light and doors.

<b>Used technologies:</b> 
Arduino, Autodesk 123D Design (3D modeling), Ultimaker (3D printing)



**Features:**
- Contactless menu and ordering

Tables have buttons that send signals to a display in the kitchen that prints the tableâ€™s number. This simulated the idea of clients using tablets to send their orders directly to the kitchen. Tables are 3D modeled and printed especially to match buttons.
- Rain protection

The restaurant has a terrace with umbrellas that open if there is a possibility of rain. This feature is implemented by using humidity sensor, servo motor and special paper folding technique - for umbrellas to open up.
- Sensor light

In the restroom, the light (diode tape) automatically turns on if the ultrasonic sensor detects motion in the room.
- Sensor door

Rotating door stops the motion when there are people incoming; it is implemented with ultrasonic sensor and motor.
